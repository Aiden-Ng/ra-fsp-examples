1. Project Overview:

    This project demonstrates the basic functionality of Netx Crypto on Renesas RA MCUs based on SCE9 Hardware acceleration operating in an AzureRTOS environment. The example project executes ECC,RSA and AES algorithms(including different chaining modes) each in its own thread in multi threaded environment. 

From the RTT viewer, user can enter 1 to enable sequential execution of the different algorithms. The order of execution is AES -> ECC -> RSA Thread. In this mode, the example project uses ThreadX timer to keep track of the time used in each algorithm execution. Similarly, user can enter 2 to disable the sequential operation so the different application threads are executed in a round robin mechanism.  

The algorithms being executed, and the operational status will be displayed on Jlink RTT viewer.



2. To run this example project, user needs to compile and download the example project to the evaluation kit and then follow below instructions to observe the operation of the system.
	Supported RA Boards:
	SCE9 - EK_RA4M2, EK_RA4M3, EK_RA6M4, EK_RA6M5

3. Hardware and Software Requirements:
   
   Hardware : 
	1) RA board 
	2) 1x Micro USB device cable
	3) A PC running Windows 10 with at least 1 USB port for debug
    
   Software: 
        1) Jlink RTT viewer

NOTE:
1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x20000b54
   b. Keil: Not Available 
   c. IAR: Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).
