# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Host MSC module using FileX on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. FileX interface on USBX uses the underlying
HMSC driver to perform various file operations such as File create, Write, Read, Display current directory and Eject the USB Pendrive.
These operations are done via FileX interface, on underlying USBX_HMSC driver based on user input from the RTT Viewer.
The application status messages will be displayed on the Jlink RTT Viewer.

* Callback:  
ux_host_usr_event_notification callback function is called to identify the USB events and perform operation as per the received events, also there are only two events available in the EP, they are used to signal the HMSC that USB communication can be started.
1. When event UX_FSP_DEVICE_INSERTION is received the USBX_HMSC checks for the interface msc class and sets the event flag to perform USBX_HMSC operation (i.e create directory/write/read/eject/display).
2. When event UX_FSP_DEVICE_REMOVAL is received the USBX_HMSC will clear the event flag and will wait for USB_INSERTION event.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the project EP.
2. Now, flash USBX HMSC code on RA board which will acts as host device.
3. Open RTT viewer and perform host device operation as per MENU Option.
