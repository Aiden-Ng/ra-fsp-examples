# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of Netx Crypto on Renesas RA MCUs based on SCE9 Hardware acceleration operating in an AzureRTOS environment. The example project executes ECC,RSA and AES algorithms(including different chaining modes) each in its own thread in multi threaded environment.

From the RTT viewer, user can enter any key to enable concurrent execution of the different algorithms.

The algorithms being executed, and the operational status will be displayed on Jlink RTT viewer.


Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the NetX crypto example project, the following resources are needed.

### Hardware ###
* Renesas RAâ„¢ MCU kit
