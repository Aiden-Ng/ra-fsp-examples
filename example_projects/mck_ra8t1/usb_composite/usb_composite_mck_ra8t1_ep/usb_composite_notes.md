# Introduction #

The sample code accompanying with this file shows operation of a Composite Device using the USB FS peripheral on a RA MCU. 
USB Composite Class allows the device to enumerate as one or more USB device class. For e.g.: When connected to a PC, 
this sample code will show enumeration of a USB Mass Storage Device and a CDC Device. 
This allows the Host to simultaneously transfer communications data over the CDC, and perform file transfer using the Mass Storage Class.
Such functionality is popular for applications that require a console interface to view status of the system, 
and ability to accept configuration information for modifying operating modes of the system.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage  | Searchable Keyword (using New Stack > Search) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| USB composite |USB composite device works as a USB Peripheral by combining two peripheral device classes and r_usb_basic module. | USB composite |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
| :-------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------: |
|   configuration.xml -> g_basic USB Driver on R_USB_Basic > Settings > Property > Module g_basic USB Driver on R_USB_Basic > USB RTOS Callback  |   NULL   |   usb_composite_callback   |   As RTOS is used, so the callback function is set and this callback function will notify user about occurance of usb events.   |
|   configuration.xml -> g_basic USB Driver on R_USB_Basic > Settings > Property > Module g_basic USB Driver on R_USB_Basic > USB Speed  |   Full Speed   |   Hi Speed   |   This is changed to showcase Hi Speed functionality. Applicable only for EK_RA6M3/G, EK-RA8M1 board.   |
|   configuration.xml -> g_basic USB Driver on R_USB_Basic > Settings > Property > Module g_basic USB Driver on R_USB_Basic > USB Module Number  |   USB_IP0   |   USB_IP1   |   This is changed to USB_IP1,when USB Hi Speed is selected for EK_RA6M3/G, EK-RA8M1 board.   |
|   configuration.xml -> Composite Thread > Settings > Property > Thread > Stack Size  |   1024   |   2048   |   This is changed to handle its worst-case function call nesting and local variable usage.   |
|   configuration.xml -> Composite Thread > Settings > Property > Thread > Dynamic Allocation support  |   Disabled   |   Enabled   |   RTOS objects can be created using RAM that is automatically allocated from the FreeRTOS heap.   |
|   configuration.xml -> Composite Thread > Settings > Property > Thread > Total Heap Size  |   0   |   10000   |   This is changed because Dynamic Allocation support is enabled, so application makes use of amount of RAM available in the FreeRTOS heap.   |

## API Usage ##

The table below lists the FSP provided API used at the application layer by this example project.

| API Name    | Usage                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|R_USB_Read | This API is used to Read data from tera term, when USB Write complete state event occur. |
|R_USB_Write| This API is used to Write back the read data from mcu to tera term, when USB READ complete state event occur.|
|R_USB_PeriControlDataGet| This API is used to get the class request, when USB class request type is USB_PCDC_SET_LINE_CODING .|
|R_USB_PeriControlDataSet| This API is used to set the class request, when USB class request type is USB_PCDC_GET_LINE_CODING .|
|R_USB_PeriControlStatusSet| This API is used to set the USB status as ACK response, when USB class request type is USB_PCDC_SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE .|
|R_USB_Close| This API is used to close the opened USB instance, when any failure occur.|
|R_IOPORT_PinWrite| This API is used to toggle the LED pin state, when USB class request type is USB_PCDC_SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE .| 

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP(*see section Starting Development* of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open rtt viewer to see the output 
and connect to Tera Term for writing and reading back the data. One can also copy the files to media manually.

Below images showcases the output on JLinkRTT_Viewer :

## Special Topics ##

### Developing Descriptor ###
Refer **Descriptor** section of [usb_composite_descriptor](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b___c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e.html) for developing  a descriptor.
We can take template file of required usb combination from mentioned path in above link and use the same in source folder by removing the .template file extension.

### Pipe Selection ###
* For Bulk In/Out transfers, USB Pipe1 to USB Pipe5 can be used for both usb_pcdc and usb_pmsc operations. The ability of a Pipe to support a USB transfer can be found in the MCU Group User's Manual: Hardware.         
    **Note :** XML configurator will throw an error when same pipes are selected for usb_pcdc and usb_pmsc. Hence it is recommended to select different pipes for usb_pcdc and usb_pmsc.
* For Interrupt, USB Pipe6 to USB Pipe9 can be used for usb_pcdc operation.
