# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Host CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. Board 1 acts as Host device running USBX HCDC-ACM example project and Board 2 acts as Peripheral device running USBX PCDC-ACM example project and connected with micro USB cable via OTG. 
The peripheral initiates the communication and once the host reads the data initiated by the peripheral. The host will then send predefined data to the peripheral and the device will echo the data back to the host. 
The application status messages will be displayed on the Jlink RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##

The table below lists the FSP provided API used at the application layer by this example project.

| API Name    | Usage                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|_ux_system_initialize|This API is used to initialize the USBx system. |
|ux_host_stack_initialize|This API is used to initialize the USBx device stack.  |
|ux_host_class_cdc_acm_write|This API is used to write to the CDC class.|
|ux_host_class_cdc_acm_read|This API is used to read from the CDC class.|
|R_USB_Open|This API opens the USB basic driver.|

**Callback:**  
ux_host_usr_event_notification callback function is called to identify the USB events and perform operation as per the received events, Also there are only two events available in the EP, they are used to signal the HCDC that USB communication can be started.
1. When event UX_FSP_DEVICE_INSERTION is received the USBX_HCDC checks for the interface cdc class and sets the event flag to perform USBX_HCDC operation(i.e write/read).
2. When event UX_FSP_DEVICE_REMOVAL is received the USBX_HCDC will clear the event flag and will wait for USB_INSERTION event.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the USBX PCDC and USBX HCDC EP.
2. Now, flash USBX PCDC code on RA board(i.e board 2) which will acts as peripheral device.
3. Open RTT viewer for Board 2.
4. Next, flash USBX HCDC code on another RA Board (i.e board 1) which will acts as host device.
5. Open RTT viewer for Board 1 and verify host device operation.

**Note:** Both USBX HCDC and PCDC board needs to be running at High Speed or Full Speed in order for the correct EP functionality.

## Special Topics ##
* How to Switch between USB FS to HS for MCU supporting both USB speed:
1. Select the USB Speed and USB Module Number from configuration property as per supported USB speed.
2. Configure the DMA Source Address and DMA Destination Address, according to the USB speed selected.

3. When using DMAC, Configure the transfer size as per the selected USB Speed (i.e For FS: 2 bytes and HS: 4 bytes).
