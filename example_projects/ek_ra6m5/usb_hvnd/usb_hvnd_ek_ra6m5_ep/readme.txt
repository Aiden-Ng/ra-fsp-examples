1. Project Overview:
    This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USB Host Vendor class driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
    In this example, the application will configure the MCU as a Vendor Host device. This Host device will be connected to the 
    USB Peripheral Vendor device which is another RA board.After the enumeration is completed, the Vendor Host board will write
    15 Bytes of data to the Vendor Peripheral board and read back the same data from the Vendor Peripheral board.The Vendor Host
    and Vendor Peripheral applications are designed to continuously transfer data between both the boards. User will be able to 
    see all the operation sequence and status on JLink RTTViewer.

2. Supported Boards:
	EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5

3. Hardware Requirements:
    	External Hardware : USB OTG cable   - 1 nos
                            USB Cable	    - 3 nos
	EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5 - Running USB HVND Example Project 
	Any RA board running USB PVND Example Project

4. Configuration changes to switch Speed in configurator: 

    i.  Full-Speed : (EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5)
        USB Speed                     :    Full Speed
        USB Module Number             :    USB_IP0 Port

    ii. High-Speed :(EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G)
        USB Speed                     :    Hi Speed
        USB Module Number             :    USB_IP1 Port

5. Hardware Connections:
	Connect Board 1, running USB HVND Example Project, through OTG cable to Board 2, running USB PVND Example Project.

	EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5(Full Speed)
	Jumper J12 placement is pins 1-2
	Remove jumper J15 pins	
	Connect the micro USB end of the micro USB device cable to micro-AB USB Full Speed port (J11) of the board.
