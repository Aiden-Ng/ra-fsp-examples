# Introduction #

The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of CAN-FD running on Renesas RA MCUs using 2 RA boards (namely B1 and B2).
In this sample code, if user enters input(any Key) on B1 via the RTT, it transmits data1 to B2.
On reception of data1, B2 displays the received data on RTT and transmits the updated data(data2) back to B1 as acknowledgment.
On reception of data2, B1 displays the received data on RTT. Upon successful reception of data2, B1 changes mode from CAN to CAN-FD and transmits data3 to B2 using CAN-FD frame.
B2 receives the data3, displays it on RTT and transmits data4 to B1 using CAN-FD frame as an acknowledgement.
B1 receives the data4 as acknowledgement, notifies application that transaction is completed and received ACK from B2 for both the transactions.
Also once the transmission is completed, Boards prints the transmitted & received data on to RTTViewer.

**Note**: In this example project, the same code runs on both boards. The board from which the user initiates the transmission becomes the board1 and board which receives the data becomes board2.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage  | Searchable Keyword|
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CANFD | CANFD module is used to support CAN with both flexible data rate and classic frame, to support multiple channel operation and gateway function. | CAN |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

**Note**: Following is the formula for data and nominal bitrate calculation.

**bitrate = canfd_clock_hz / ((time_segment_1 + time_segment_2 + 1) * prescalar)**

Refer [FSP User Manual on GitHub](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___c_a_n_f_d.html) for more details like min, max values of time_segment_1, time_segment_2 and prescalar.

Sample bit rate calculation is provided as below:

For example, if the user desires to configure nominal bitrate of 500Kbits/sec, the following values can be used in configurator:

canfd_clock_hz = 40MHz

time_segment_1 = 20

time_segment_2 = 19

prescalar = 2

These values are chosen by taking reference of ek-ra6m5 hardware user manual from the **Section 32.4.1**

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of [FSP User Manual](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/_s_t_a_r_t__d_e_v.html)) in both boards. After running the EP, open rtt viewer to input key for initiating the operation.
Before running the example project, refer the below steps for hardware connections :
* Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 
* E33, E34, E35 on the board needs to be shorted to use on-board CAN Transreceivers
* CANH, CANL and GND on both boards needs to be connected.
