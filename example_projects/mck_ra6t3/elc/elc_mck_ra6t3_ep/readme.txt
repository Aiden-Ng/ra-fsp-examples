1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the typical use of the ELC HAL module APIs.
        ELC Software Event, GPT0 and GPT1 events are linked using ELC. The start source for GPT0 and GPT1 is ELC Software Event and
        the stop source for GPT1 is GPT0 counter overflow. GPT1 runs in PWM mode and GPT0 runs in one-shot mode.
        On giving valid RTT input, an ELC Software Event is generated that triggers LED blinking.
        LED stops blinking after 5 sec when GPT0 expires.
		
2. Hardware Settings:
    Hardware Connection
 
    For EK-RA2L1:
    Connect P414(J1 Pin 04) --> P505(J3 Pin 06)

    For EK-RA2E1:
    Connect P212 to P913 (User LED3)﻿

    For EK-RA6M5:
    Connect P414(J1 Pin 32) to P006 (J4-28)

    For FPB-RA4E1:
    Connect P104 (J4 Pin 21) -–> P407 (J3 Pin 25) (LED2) 

1) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x2000044c
   b. Keil: Not Available 
   c. IAR: Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).
