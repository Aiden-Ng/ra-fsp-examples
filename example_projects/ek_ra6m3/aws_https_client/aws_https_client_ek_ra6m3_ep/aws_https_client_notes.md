# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the AWS HTTPS client library with Ethernet driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using FreeRTOS. 
The AWS client is used to connect to the HTTPS adafruit server, which is a cloud platform. 
Upon successful connection, the menu is displayed allowing the user to send GET, PUT, POST requests to the adafruit server. 
On POST/PUT request, MCU die temperature is read via(using) ADC and uploaded to server. 
On GET request, the most recently uploaded MCU die temperature data is read from the adafruit server. 
JLink RTT Viewer is used to display the status and responses of the requests made to the server.

## Verifying operation ##

**Note 1:** To run the application with the supplied key, certificate and code, user need not require to create Adafruit account with login of their own login credentials. Here in this case the output can only be seen on the RTT console. This is the default behavior of the application with the supplied code.  
**Note 2:** If the user wants access to Adafruit Dashboard, modify the application along with your own keys, you are required to sign up and create an account with your desired login credentials(if you don't have one). The steps for creating the account, generating the private Key and certificate are explained in the Special Topics sections.  
**Note 3:** After the sign up and login to Adafruit account, you can create feed on the Dashboard and generate ADAFRUIT IO Key, for your own creation of new feeds.

Import, Build and Debug the EP(*see section Starting Development* of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open RTT viewer to see the output.

Below images showcase the output on JLink RTT Viewer :


![aws_https_client](images/rtt_viewer_banner_pre_IP.jpg "RTT viewer starting page and pre IP Init")

![aws_https_client](images/rtt_viewer_post_IP_GET_request.jpg "RTT viewer post IP Init and GET request")

![aws_https_client](images/rtt_viewer_PUT_POST_request.jpg "RTT viewer PUT and POST request")

After executing the menu options, the updated data will be shown in the user feed on the Adafruit IO server.
To view user feed data, Click on Feeds and select the created feed.
Below image show the adafruit server with feed data:

![aws_https_cleint](images/adafruit_server_data.jpg "adafruit server page")



## Special Topics ##

**1. Obtaining Adafruit server credentials:**

Following steps guide you how to obtain the username and AIO key.

1.Go to https://io.adafruit.com. Click on **Get Started for Free** to create an account or **Sign In** if already created as shown in the  below image

![aws_https_client](images/adafruit_getstart.jpg "adafruit getting started")

2. Create an account by providing the requested details as shown in below image to obtain user credentials viz., **username** and **password**   
![aws_https_client](images/adafruit_sign_up.jpg "adafruit sign up")  
3. After successful creation of account, user name will display on top of the page as shown in below image. Click on **IO**, dashboard will displays with the following options **Feeds , Dashboards, My key** etc.


 ![aws_https_client](images/adafruit_dashboard.jpg "adafruit dashboard")
 
 4.  Click on My Key option to see your username and Active key. These two details are important for communicating with adafruit server. 
 If the key is compromised, we can generate the new key by clicking on the Regenerate key option as shown in below image. 
 The Active Key and Username generated are required and used in the usr_app.h as explained in the section 4 of Creation of Adafruit Feeds.  
 
 ![aws_https_client](images/adafruit_io_key.jpg "adafruit io key") 
 
 
**2. Creation of Adafruit Feeds:**  

1. For creating a new feed, go to Feeds -> view all, as shown in the image below:

![aws_https_cleint](images/feed_view_all.jpg "View all Adafruit feeds")  

2. Then click on the "+New Feed" button, a dialog box will appear to Create a new Feed. Fill the name and description of feed and click on "Create" button, as shown in below image.  

![aws_https_cleint](images/feed_creation.jpg "Create Adafruit feeds")  

3. Once the feed is created, Open the created feed and click on Privacy and select Visibility as Public through drop down menu and save as shown in below image:  
Also, User can add data manually for the feed using the dashboard.  
![aws_https_cleint](images/feed_visibility.jpg "Adafruit feeds visibility selection")  
4. After obtaining the user name, Active key from the "your ADAFRUIT IO Key" Pop-up window and creating the feed. User has to update the following details at respective URL macros in the aws_https_client_ep/src/user_app.h file as shown in the below image.  
 Use GET url: https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/{**username**}/feeds/{feed_key}/data?limit=1  
#define IOT_DEMO_HTTPS_PRESIGNED_GET_URL   "https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/**mnkraj1**/feeds/**temp**/data?limit=1"  
#define IOT_DEMO_HTTPS_PRESIGNED_PUT_POST_URL    "https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/**mnkraj1**/feeds/**temp**/data/"  


![aws_https_cleint](images/user_config_data.jpg "user configuration macros")  



**3. Obtaining Server Certificate:**

1. Open browser and copy paste the following URL http://cacerts.geotrust.com/GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt. Server certificate with .crt extension will be downloaded with the file name **GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt**

2. After downloaded the .crt file, need to be convert to .pem format using OpenSSL.

3. OpenSSL can be downloaded from  https://www.openssl.org/source/. depends on the Operating System, required installer can be downloaded and installed.

4. Copy the downloaded certificate to the bin folder of your installed openssl.

5. Open the cmd prompt in Administrator mode from the bin folder as shown in the below image.

 ![aws_https_client](images/openssl_win.jpg "OpenSSL window")

 6. Type the conversion command :**Openssl.exe x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt -out GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt.pem** as shown below image
 
 ![aws_https_client](images/openssl_conversion_cmd.jpg "OpenSSL conversion command")
 
 7. GeoTrustRSACA2018.crt.pem file will be generated in your bin folder as shown in below image.
 
![aws_https_client](images/openssl_bin.jpg "openssl bin folder")

8. Open the converted certificate file with notepad and copy the content and update in the aws_https_client_ep\src\usr_app.h file at the **IOT_HTTPS_TRUSTED_ROOT_CA** macro as shown in below image.

![aws_https_client](images/server_certificate.jpg "server certificate macro updation")




**4. Obtaining Client Certificate and Private Key:**

1. Open the cmd prompt from the bin folder of installed Openssl. 
![aws_https_client](images/openssl_win.jpg "OpenSSL window")

2. To generate the private key and CSR certificate use the command **openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout clientside.key -x509 -days 365 -out clientside.crt**  as shown below.

![aws_https_client](images/open_ssl_client_key.jpg "OpenSSL Client Key")

3. clientside.key and clientside.crt files are generated in binary folder. Verify client certificate is properly generated by using command **openssl x509 -text -noout -in clientside.crt** as shown below.  
**NOTE:** clientside.key is the private key which is used on the client side and clientside.crt is the certificate used on the client side.
![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_Certificate_validation.jpg "OpenSSL Client Key validation")

4. Generated client certificate is in .crt format. It has to be converted to .pem format. Conversion can be done from .crt to .der and then .der to .pem. 
To convert from .crt to .der, Use the command **openssl x509 -in clientside.crt -outform der -out clientside.der** as shown below.

![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_crt_der_conversion.jpg "OpenSSL format conversion")

5. To convert .der to .pem use the command **openssl x509 -inform der -in clientside.der -out clientside.pem** as shown below.

![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_der_pem_conversion.jpg "OpenSSL format conversion")

6. The generated files can be found in bin folder of OpenSSL installed software as shown in below image.

![aws_https_client](images/openSSL_Generated_files.jpg "OpenSSL Generated files")

7. Open the generated files in notepad and copy the content and paste in the aws_https_client_ep/src/usr_app.h 

 i . Copied client certificate to be update at the CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM macro as shown in below image.
 
 ![aws_https_client](images/update_client_certificate.jpg "Update client certificate pem")
 
 ii. Copied client key to be update at the CLIENT_KEY_PEM macro as shown in below image.
 
  ![aws_https_client](images/update_client_key.jpg "Update client key pem")
  
  
**NOTE:** Client Certificate and client Key are required for AWS Client application to authenticate server in secure connection. If missing of both, then it cannot be connect to server instead return an error as no certificates were found.
