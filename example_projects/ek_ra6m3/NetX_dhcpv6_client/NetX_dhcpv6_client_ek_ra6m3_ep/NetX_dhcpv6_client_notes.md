# Introduction #

The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a NetX Duo DHCPv6 Client on a RA MCU using Azure RTOS. 
In this sample code, a NetX Duo IP instance is created with IP address as (default 0.0.0.0 - Not assigned). 
The NetX stack is enabled for UDP, ICMP, ARP, IPV6, ICMPv6. DHCP Client uses the UDP for sending and receiving DHCP messages. 
DHCP Client creates its own packet pool based on the settings minimum packet payload size and number of packets in the packet pool. 
When DHCP Client is created and started, a Client first broadcasts a SOLICIT message to begin the process of requesting a global IPv6 address assignment,
and it waits for the valid IP address to be assigned from the DHCPv6 server.
After the successful DHCP messages are exchanged server leases and assigns the IP address to the client, now the Board can ping to the DHCP server. 
When the server assigns the client an IP address, it may also supply other network information, such as a DNS server, Gateway address etc. 
The status messages, Acquired IP addresses, and client's assigned IANA lease data, and the code flow informational messages as part of the 
initialization are displayed on the JlinkRTTViewer.

NetX Duo DHCPV6 Client is compliant with [RFC3315](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315) , [RFC3646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3646) , and related RFCs.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage  | Searchable Keyword (using New Stack > Search) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| NetX Duo DHCP IPV6 Client | DHCPV6 Client module is used for dynamic global IPv6 address assignment from a DHCPv6 server and to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, thus allowing them to use network services such as DNS, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP.| dhcp |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
| :-------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------: |
|   configuration.xml -> BSP > Properties > Settings > Property >Main Stack Size (bytes)| 0x400 |0x1000| Main Program thread stack is configured to store the local variables of different functions in the code. |
|   configuration.xml -> BSP > Properties > Settings > Property > Heap Size (bytes)| 0 |0x2000| Heap size is required for standard library functions to be used. |
|   configuration.xml -> g_dhcpv6_client0 NetX Duo DHCP IPv6 Client > Settings > Property > Common > Common > Duplicate Address Detection  |  Enabled    |   Disabled   |  Duplicate Address Detection property is disabled to avoid detecting any duplicate address.  |
|   configuration.xml -> DHCP Client Thread > Settings > Property > Thread > priority  |   1   |   3   |   DHCP Client thread priority is lowered to allow the IP thread to process incoming packets at the fastest rate possible.   |
|   configuration.xml -> RTT Thread > Settings > Property > Thread > priority  |   1   |   4   |   RTT thread priority is lowered to allow the DHCP Client and IP threads to process incoming packets at the fastest rate possible.   |

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open rtt viewer to see the output.
Before running the example project, refer the below steps for hardware connections :
* Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 
* Connect an Ethernet cable to the RJ45 connector on RA MCU via ethernet switch/hub which is connected to Router or LAN where DHCP server is residing.
* A DHCPV6 Server needs to exist on the network to assign  an IP address to the RA MCU running this DHCP Client Example Project.
