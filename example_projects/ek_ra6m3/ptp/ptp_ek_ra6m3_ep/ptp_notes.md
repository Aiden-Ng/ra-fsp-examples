# Introduction #

The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a PTP module on a RA MCU using Azure RTOS. 
In this sample code, a NetX Duo IP instance is created with IP address as (default 0.0.0.0 - Not assigned).  
The NetX stack is enabled for UDP, ICMP, and ARP. DHCP client is used to getting the IP address from the DHCP server 
for RA board IP assignment. DHCP Client uses the UDP for sending and receiving DHCP messages.  
When DHCP Client is created and started, DHCP messages are exchanged, it waits for a valid IP address to be assigned from the DHCPv4 server.

Once the PTP module is opened, set the local clock id, MAC address, IP address and configure the PTP instance to operate as an end to end Slave.
It will get the current timestamp from Raspberry-Pi or another RA board master clock and upon successful reception of timestamp,
the timestamp will be displayed on Jlink RTTViewer.

NetX Duo DHCP Client is compliant with [RFC2132](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132), [RFC2131](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131).

The status messages, ptp info, and the code flow informational messages as part of the initialization are displayed on the JlinkRTTViewer.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Run the PTP master(ptp4l), user need to follow steps as described under **[Special Topics](#special-topics)**.   

	* PTP master will be running in Raspberry-Pi, where the PC will be on the same network setup similar to RA MCU kit.
	* If Raspberry-Pi is not available, then use another RA board to run PTP master and follow the steps as described under **[Special Topics](#special-topics)**.
		 
2. Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of **FSP User Manual**). 
Before running the example project, refer to the below steps for hardware connections :
	* Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 
	* Connect an Ethernet cable to the RJ45 connector on RA MCU via ethernet switch/hub which is connected to Router or LAN where DHCP server is residing.
	* A DHCP Server needs to exist on the network to assign  an IP address to the RA MCU running this PTP Example Project.

   After running the EP, open RTT viewer to see the output.    
   Below images shows an example of output observed on JLinkRTT_Viewer:

## Special Topics ##

### Steps to run the PTP master(ptp4l) on Raspberry-Pi : 
* Install linuxptp on Rapsberry pi using *"apt install linuxptp"* command, If clock fails to start please upgrade system packages by using command *"sudo apt upgrade"*.
* Once linuxptp is installed check ptp capabilities by using *"ethtool -T enp0s3"*. Here enp0s3 or any other Ethernet port can be verified by *"ifconfig"* command in Raspberry-Pi for active Ethernet port.    
  ![ptp_time_stamping_capabilities](images/time_stamping_capabilities.jpg "Time stamping capabilities")
* If at least software transmit and receive is available upon running above command then we can proceed to run ptp4l(using sudo) as below:
  ![ptp_master_with_ptp4l_commands](images/ptp4l_command.jpg "PTP master ptp4l Command")
    
* Refer below terminal log :  
      
  ![ptp_master_with_ptp4l](images/linux_master.jpg "PTP master")	

### Steps to run the PTP master on another RA board :
* To run the EP in master mode, user should update the **PTP_MASTER_MODE** macro value present in the **ptp_ek_ra6m3_ep\src\ptp_ep.h** file as shown in below image.
      
  ![ptp_master_mode_update](images/master_mode_enable.jpg "PTP master mode update macro")
  
  Also user should change the MAC address (different from the slave) of the EK-RA6M3 master board to allow proper DHCP configuration.  
  ![ptp_master_mode_mac_address](images/master_mode_mac.jpg "PTP master mode mac address")
  
  
* Generate, Build and Debug the EP. Before running the example project, refer to the below steps for hardware connections :
     * Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 
     * Connect an Ethernet cable to the RJ45 connector on RA MCU via Ethernet switch/hub which is connected to Router or LAN where DHCP server is residing.
     * A DHCP Server needs to exist on the network to assign  an IP address to the RA MCU running this PTP Example Project.

  After running the EP, open RTT viewer to see the output.    
  Below images shows an example of output observed on JLinkRTT_Viewer:

  ![ptp_master_rtt_output](images/master_mode_banner.jpg "PTP Master Banner")

  ![ptp_master_rtt_output](images/master_mode_rtt_log.jpg "PTP Master RTT Log")


* User can obtain the local clock time in their time zone by changing the **TIME_ZONE_OFFSET** macro value present in the **ptp_ek_ra6m3_ep\src\ptp_ep.h** file as shown in below image.

  ![ptp_time_zone_update](images/time_zone_macro_udate.jpg "PTP Time zone update macro")       
  Refer [timezone](https://www.epochconverter.com/timezones) for getting **TIME_ZONE_OFFSET** macro value as per required timezone.  
  
  **Note:** Currently EP does not support pulse timer feature.
