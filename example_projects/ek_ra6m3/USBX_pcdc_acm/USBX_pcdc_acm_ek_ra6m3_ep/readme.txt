1. Project Overview:

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Device CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. In this example project, user will use the RA board as a CDC device which will enumerate as a COM port when connected to the host PC. Once the COM port is enabled, user can provide input from the Serial terminal. User input will be echoed on the serial terminal. The application status messages will be displayed on the Jlink RTT Viewer.
 
2. To run this example project, user needs to compile and download the example project to the evaluation kit and then follow below instructions to observe    the operation of the system.

   Supported Boards: EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4 and EK-RA6M5:

   	1) On the host PC, open Windows Device Manager. Expand Ports (COM & LPT), locate USB Serial Device (COMxx) and note down 
           the COM port number for reference in the next step. 
   
   	2) Open the serial port of the device using tera term.
   
   	3) Open the RTT viewer to view the application status messages.
     
3. Hardware and Software Requirements:
   
   Hardware : 
	1) RA board 
	2) 2x Micro USB device cable
	3) A PC with at least 2 USB port(1 for debug and 1 for COM port)
    
   Software: 
	1) Serial Terminal/TeraTerm
        2) Windows® 10 operating system 
	3) USB Serial Drivers (included in Windows 10) 
        4) Jlink RTT viewer

4. Configuration changes to switch Speed in configurator: 

    	i.  Full-Speed : (EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M4)
            USB Speed                     :    Full Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP0 Port

        ii. High-Speed :(EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M5)
            USB Speed                     :    Hi Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP1 Port
