# Introduction #

This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of USBX Device Mass Storage Class module
on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. RA Board will act as a device MSC 
peripheral. The USBX PMSC driver internally configures memory device (block media with sdmmc) to 
enumerate as a   memory drive on host PC. User can read, write and perform various file operations
on the disk. The system initialization status and any errors occurred will be printed on the RTT
viewer.


Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the USBX PMSC example project, the following resources are needed.

### Hardware ###
* Renesas RAâ„¢ MCU kit with USB Support.
* 2x USB A to USB Micro B Cable.(One for onboard debugger and other for USB MSC connection).
* PC running Windows 10.
* 1x [PMOD](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-sd-full-sized-sd-card-slot/) based full sized SD Card or Micro SD CARD with Adapter.
  Connect PMOD: use short wiring connections (should be shorter than 10cm).

Refer to [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for information on how to connect the hardware.


### Software ###
1. Refer to the software required section in [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

|ux_device_stack_initialize| This API is used to initialize the USBX device stack.  |
|R_USB_Open|This API opens the USB basic driver.|

Refer to [Description of USBX Device Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/rtos/usbx/usbx-device-stack-4) for more details of API used.

* Callback :  
  **usbx_status_callback()** is a user callback function which is registered as 9th argument of **ux_device_stack_initialize** API. 
  This callback is invoked by USBX to indicate to the application level about USB Attach and Removed events.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the project EP.
2. Now, flash USBX PMSC code on RA board.
3. Open RTT viewer to see the output. 
4. User can also copy the files to media manually.

Below images showcases the output on JLinkRTT_Viewer :

## Special Topics ##

### Developing Descriptor ###
Refer **Descriptor** section of [Device Class (rm_usbx_port)](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b_x.html) for developing  a descriptor.
We can take template file of required usb combination from mentioned path in above link and use the same in source folder by removing the **.template** file extension.

### Operations for changing the last LBA ###
* Last lba is getting set to media total sector in **usb_peri_usbx_pmsc_storage_init()** function in **rm_usbx_port.c** file as shown below.

![last_lba_ops](images/last_lba_ops_1.jpg "Last LBA Operation")

* Media total sector is acquired from the **infoGet()** API during initialization in **usb_peri_usbx_pmsc_media_initialize()** function as shown below.
