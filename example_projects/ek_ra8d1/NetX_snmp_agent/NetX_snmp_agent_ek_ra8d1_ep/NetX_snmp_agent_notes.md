# Introduction #

The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a NetX Duo SNMP Agent on a RA MCU using Azure RTOS. 
In this sample code, a NetX Duo IP instance is created with IP address as (default 0.0.0.0 - Not assigned).  
The NetX stack is enabled for UDP, ICMP, ARP. SNMP is a protocol that utilizes the connectionless User Datagram Protocol (UDP) services to perform its management function. 
SNMP Agent creates its own packet pool based on the settings minimum packet payload size and number of packets in the packet pool.

Once SNMP Agent is created and initialized,  An agent is responsible for responding to SNMP Manager’s commands and sending event driven traps. 
On pressing any key from JlinkRTTViewer, the Agent sends trap event to the manager.

The status messages, client's info, and the code flow informational messages as part of the initialization are displayed on the JlinkRTTViewer.

NetX Duo SNMP Agent is compliant with [RFC1157](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1157.html), [RFC1155](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1155.html),
[RFC1215](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1215.html), [RFC1901](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1901.html), [RFC1905](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1905.html),

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open RTT viewer to see the output.
Before running the example project, refer to the below steps for hardware connections :
* Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 
* Connect an Ethernet cable to the RJ45 connector on RA MCU via ethernet switch/hub which is connected to Router or LAN where DHCP server is residing.
* Run the SNMP Agent code on RA MCU.
* For running the SNMP Manager services, user need to follow steps as described under **[Special Topics](#special-topics)**.     
  Note: Linux machine or Raspberry pi is used as the Machine which runs the SNMP Manager services.
* Verify SNMP Agent Example Project operation on the RA MCU using Jlink RTTViewer. 

Below image showcases the hardware connection setup required for running the EP :

## Special Topics ##
* Steps to run the shell scripts :   
  To install SNMP Manager and trap server manually, user can run following shell scripts on linux or Raspberry pi terminal.
  1. Open the linux terminal and run the shell script [install_snmp_manager.sh](images/install_snmp_manager.sh) which will install SNMP manager services.
    Refer screenshot below:
	![snmp_install_services](images/snmp_install_services.jpg "Install SNMP Manager services")
	
	 **Note:** In case the shell script [install_snmp_manager.sh](images/install_snmp_manager.sh) fails to execute, User should open linux or Raspberry pi terminal and execute below command to perform SNMP manager package installation.               
	   1. sudo apt install snmptrapd
	   2. sudo apt install snmpd
	   3. sudo apt install snmp
		   
  2. Open the file **snmptrapd.conf** using command **"vim /etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf"**.
  
  3. Copy the below command and paste it to the end of the snmptrapd.conf file, save and close the file. 
       
	   authCommunity log,execute,net public  
	   createUser -e 0x8000c73803003055234455 public SHA "authpassword" DES "privpassword"  
	   authUser log public
	 
	   Refer the screenshot below:
	   
	  ![snmp_manager_snmpconfig_command](images/snmp_manager_snmpconfig_command.jpg "Command for snmpd.conf file")
	 
  4. Run the shell script [snmp_manager_agent_test.sh](snmp_manager_agent_test.sh) to perform SET,GET,GETNEXT operation with different version of SNMP agent.
     Refer the screenshot below:

	 ![snmp_manager_script](images/snmp_manager_script.jpg "SNMP Manager services script")
	 
	  **Note:** User should update IP address of RA kit inside [snmp_manager_agent_test.sh](snmp_manager_agent_test.sh), the RA board IP address is displayed on JLink RTT viewer.
	    Refer the screenshot below:
			  
	    ![board_IP_address](images/board_IP_address.jpg "RA board (i.e Agent) IP address")
		  
	    Open [run_snmp_manager.sh](run_snmp_manager.sh) shell script and update the variable **AGENT_ADDR** with  IP address of RA kit.  
		Refer the screenshot below :
			  
	    ![snmp_agent_IP_address_update](images/snmp_agent_IP_address_update.jpg "Command for updating Agent IP address")
		  
  5. Run the shell script [run_snmp_manager.sh](run_snmp_manager.sh) to verify the trap event sent by snmp agent.
     Refer the screenshot below:
	 
	 ![snmp_manager_trap](images/snmp_v2_trap_manager.jpg "manager trap event file")
  
  
* User need to change the SNMP Manager's IP address in **"snmp_agent_ep.h"** file from the Default to the Users SNMP Manager (Linux or Raspberry Pi machine's) IP address.
  Refer screenshot below:
