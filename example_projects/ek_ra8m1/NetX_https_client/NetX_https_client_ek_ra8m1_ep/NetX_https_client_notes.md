# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of NetX Duo HTTPS client with ethernet driver on Renesas RA MCUs
based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. HTTPS Client is used to connect to HTTPS Adafruit IO server which is a cloud platform.
On successful connection, menu is displayed enabling user to send GET, PUT, POST requests to Adafruit IO server. On POST/PUT
request, MCU Die temperature is read using ADC and uploaded to server. On GET request, the last MCU die temperature data
is read from the Adafruit IO server. JlinkRTTViewer is used to display the status and responses of the requests made to server.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

## Special Topics ##

**1. Obtaining Adafruit server credentials**:

Following steps guide you on how to obtain the username and AIO key from Adafruit IO server.

1.Go to https://io.adafruit.com. Click on **Get Started for Free** option as shown in the  below image

![NetX_https_client](images/adafruit_getstart.jpg "adafruit getting started")

2. Create an account by providing the requested details to obtain user credintails viz., **username** and **password** 

3. After successful creation of account, user name will display on top of the page as shown in below image. 
   Click on **IO**, Dashboard will display with the following options **Feeds , Dashboards, My key** etc.

 ![NetX_https_client](images/adafruit_dashboard.jpg "adafruit dashboard")
 
4. Click on My Key option to see your **username** and **Active key**. These two details are important for communicating with Adafruit server. If the key is compromised, we can generate the new key by clicking on the Regenerate key option as shown in below image.

5. For creating a new feed, go to Feeds -> view all, as shown in the image below:

 ![NetX_https_client](images/create_feed.jpg "creating a feed")
 
6. Then click on the "+New Feed" button, a dialog box will appear to Create a new Feed. Fill the name and description of feed and click on "Create" button, as shown in below image.
 
 ![NetX_https_client](images/create_new_feed.jpg "creating a new feed")

7. After obtaining the user name, io key, feed name from above mentioned steps(3-6). User has to update the following details at respective url macros in the **NetX_https_client_ep/src/user_app.h** file as shown in the below image.

**2. Obtaining Server Certificate:**

1. Open browser and copy paste the following url https://cacerts.digicert.com/GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.crt. Server certificate with .crt extension will be downloaded with the file name **GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.crt**

2. After downloaded the .crt file, need to be convert to .pem format using `OpenSSL`.

3. `OpenSSL` can be downloaded from  https://www.openssl.org/source/. depends on the Operating System (mainly for Linux), required installer can be downloaded and installed.

   For Windows users, `OpenSSL` can be downloaded from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.

4. Copy the downloaded certificate to the bin folder of your installed openssl.

5. User need use `git bash` to convert file to .h file. `git bash` can be downloaded  from https://git-scm.com/download.

6. Open the `git bash` in Administrator mode from the bin folder as shown in the below image.

 ![NetX_https_client](images/openssl_win.jpg "OpenSSL window")

7. Type the conversion command: **openssl.exe x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.crt -out GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.crt.pem** as shown below image
 
 ![NetX_https_client](images/openssl_conversion_cmd.jpg "OpenSSL conversion command")
 
8. GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.crt.pem file will be generated in your bin folder as shown in below image.
 
 ![NetX_https_client](images/openssl_bin.jpg "OpenSSL bin folder")

9. Convert the Certificate into a C Hex array, with command : **openssl.exe x509 -outform der -in GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.crt.pem -out GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.der; xxd -i GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.der > GeoTrustTLSRSACAG1.crt.h**.

 ![NetX_https_client](images/openssl_conversion_pem.jpg "OpenSSL bin folder")

10. The file will generate a similarly named file with a “.h” extension, which contains the C array.

 ![NetX_https_client](images/converted_certificate.jpg "Converted certificate in .h file")

11. Update the contents from the .h file in the **NetX_https_client_ep\src\https_client_app.c** file at the **ca_cert_der** array as shown in below image.
