# Introduction #

The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a NetX Duo SNTP Client on a RA MCU using Azure RTOS. 
In this sample code, a NetX Duo IP instance is created with IP address as (default 0.0.0.0 - Not assigned).  
The NetX stack is enabled for UDP, ICMP, ARP. SNTP Client uses the UDP protocol to perform time updates in a simple, stateless protocol. 
SNTP Client creates its own packet pool based on the settings minimum packet payload size and number of packets in the packet pool.
It uses the DHCP client to get the IP address from the DHCP server and DNS Client to resolve the IP address for the ntp pool server url using the DNS lookup.

Once SNTP Client is created and initialized, the Client polls its SNTP Server on regular intervals and waits to receive a reply from that Server. 
When one is received, the Client verifies that the reply contains a valid time update by applying a set of ‘sanity checks’ recommended by [RFC 4330](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4330). 
The Client then applies the time difference, if any, with the Server clock to RTC clock.

The status messages, client's info, and the code flow informational messages as part of the initialization are displayed on the JlinkRTTViewer.

NetX Duo SNTP Client is compliant with [RFC1769](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1769.html) and related RFCs.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage  | Searchable Keyword (using New Stack > Search) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| NetX Duo SNTP  Client| To get access of NetX SNTP  client library for client connection. | sntp |
| NetX Duo IP Instance | For IP communication the NetX IP instance needs to be used. SNTP  Client uses the IPV4. | NetX Duo IP|
| NetX Duo Packet Pool | Packet Pool Module is used to send and receive the created data packets over UDP network.  | NetX Duo Packet Pool |
| NetX Duo Ethernet driver | Ethernet connection is required for physical connection to connect over network. | NetX Duo Ethernet Driver |
| NetX Duo DHCP IPv4 Client | DHCPv4 module is used to obtain IP address and to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, by using network services such as DNS, SNTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP | dhcp |
| NetX Duo DNS Client | DNS Module is used as network service to get the IP address of the Domain (Server) to which the SNTP  client is getting connected. | NetX Duo DNS Client |
| RTC | RTC module is used for keeping the local system time.  And if any time difference exist between RTC clock and SNTP server clock, then RTC clock gets updated to the Network clock. | rtc  |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties that are important or different from those selected by default. 

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
| :-------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------: |
|   configuration.xml -> BSP > Properties > Settings > Property > Heap Size (bytes)| 0 |0x400| Heap size is required for standard library functions to be used as per FSP requirements. |
|   configuration.xml -> SNTP Client Thread > Settings > Property > Thread > priority  |   1   |   2   |   SNTP Client thread priority is lowered to allow the IP thread to process incoming packets at the fastest rate possible.   |
|   configuration.xml -> RTT Thread > Settings > Property > Thread > priority  |   1   |   3   |   RTT thread priority is lowered to allow the SNTP Client and IP threads to process incoming packets at the fastest rate possible.   |

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open RTT viewer to see the output.
Before running the example project, refer to the below steps for hardware connections :
* Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 
* Connect an Ethernet cable to the RJ45 connector on RA MCU via ethernet switch/hub which is connected to Router or LAN where DHCP server is residing.
* A DHCP Server needs to exist on the network to assign  an IP address to the RA MCU running this SNTP Client Example Project.

Below image showcases the hardware connection setup required for running the EP :

## Special Topics ##

* User can obtain the server time in their time zone by changing the **TIME_ZONE_OFFSET** macro value present in the **NetX_sntp_client_ek_ra6m3_ep\src\rtc_app.h** file as shown in below image.

  ![sntp_client_time_zone_update](images/sntp_client_time_zone_macro_udate.jpg "SNTP Client Time zone update macro")       
  Refer [timezone](https://www.epochconverter.com/timezones) for getting **TIME_ZONE_OFFSET** macro value as per required timezone. 
  
* To select unicast/broadcast mode, Configure the **UNICAST** macro value to '1' for unicast mode and '0' for broadcast mode in the **NetX_sntp_client_ek_ra6m3_ep\src\sntp_client_ep.h** file as shown in below image.

  ![sntp_client_mode](images/mode_select.jpg "SNTP Client mode macro") 
  
  **Note:** Currently EP works only in unicast mode. Broadcast mode is unsupported on this EP because no timestamp update is getting received in this mode.
