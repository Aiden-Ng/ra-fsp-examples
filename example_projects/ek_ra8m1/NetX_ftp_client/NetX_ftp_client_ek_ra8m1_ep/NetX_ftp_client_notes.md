# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of NetX Duo FTP client  with ethernet interface on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. In this example project, user should provide a static ip address* in Netx Duo IP instance based on their network environment. In this project NetX stack is enabled for TCP, ARP, ICMP. FTP Client utilizes the reliable Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) services to perform its data transfer. FTP Client is created and started. FTP client gets connected to FTP server and performs the read/write operation in the created file on FTP server and gets disconnected from FTP server. The status messages are displayed on the Jlink RTT Viewer. 

NetX Duo FTP is compliant with [RFC 959](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc959), [RFC 2428](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2428) and related RFCs.

***Note:** In example project, Netx Duo IP instance is having a static ip address from our test setup environment.


Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the FTP client example project, the following resources are needed.

### Hardware ###
* Renesas RAâ„¢ EK-RA6M3/EK-RA6M4/EK-RA6M5/EK-RA8M1 MCU kit with ethernet support
* Micro USB cable
* Ethernet Switch
* LAN Cable
* HOST Machine

Refer to [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for information on how to connect the hardware or refer the below steps for hardware connections:

i.  Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable. 

ii. Connect an Ethernet cable to the RJ45 connector on RA MCU via Ethernet switch or Router which is connected to the Host machine where the FTP Server is running.

Below image showcases the hardware connection setup required for running the EP :

## Special Topics ##

[Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server) should be running on the same local network.

Server should be configured with the username and password for authentication purpose of FTP client. Please follow below steps for configuring the FTP Server

**1. Setting up the Filezilla server**:

Following steps guide you on how to configure the filezilla server.

1. Download the [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server) server and install in the host machine. By default, FileZilla Server runs using the SYSTEM windows user account with full control permisions, or user can provide Account user name and Account password to run with different Windows user account. Click **Next**

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_service_setting.jpg "filezilla service setting")

2. Then, User need to choose the listening port and administration password. By default, listening port is **14148**.

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_admin_setting.jpg "filezilla administration setting")

3. Based on the installation settings, you need to fill in the information as shown in the below image. Then Click on **OK** to connect.

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_welcome_page.jpg "filezilla getting started")

4. Upon clicking on **Connect** button, filezilla server is connected and it is waiting for authentication viz., **username** and **password**.

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_waiting_for_authentication.jpg "filezilla for authentication")
 
 
5. Now click on **Server** -> **Configure...** to configures the user account as shown in the below image. Click Users.

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_user_creation.jpg "file zilla in user creation")


6. Now click on **Add** button as shown in the below image, please provide username into the field.

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_add_user.jpg "Add user") 
 
7. Now provide password into the black field as shown in the below image.

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_add_user_account.jpg "Add user account")
 
8. Now **Users** has been registered with the registered **username** and **password**.
 
  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_add_user_account_credential_ok.jpg "Add password")
 
9. Next, choose the shared folder at **Mount points** option as shown in the below image.
 
  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_add_directory.jpg "Prompt add directory")
 
10. Now click on **Add** and provide the **Virtual path** and **Native path**. The native path is a local file path, the virtual path is the path that the FTP users will see and it is mapped to the native path by FileZilla Server
 
  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_shared_folders.jpg "Add shared folder")


11. After provide the folder path, now **Check/Uncheck** the appropriate file settings at the **Mount options** like **Read Only**, **Read + Write** etc., as shown in the below image and click **OK**

  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_shared_folders_settings.jpg "Add shared folder")
 
12. Upon successfully created account settings, FileZilla server displays the message as shown in the below image and now it's ready to connect the FTP client
 
  ![ftp_client](images/file_zilla_account_settings.jpg "Account added")

13. Now user configures credentials SERVER IP address. Get credentials SERVER IP address by: open **command prompt**, type **ipconfig** (incase using window) and get IP address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway.

  ![ftp_client](images/get_ip_information.jpg "Get IP information")

14. Now user should provide credentials SERVER IP address into FileZilla Server by click on **Server** -> **Configures...** -> **Server Listener** as shown in the below image.

  ![ftp_client](images/setting_server_listener.jpg "Setting server listener")
  
15. Now user should update the code according to their server settings under **user_app.h** file in ftp_client ep as shown in the below image.
 
  ![ftp_client](images/user_app.jpg "User app")

16. Next, update the **Subnet Mask**, **Default Gateway Address** as the information from step **12**. **IPv4 Address** is client ip address, it should same **Network ID** with server ip.

  ![ftp_client](images/ftp_client_configuration.jpg "Configuration")
  
17. After update in the code, build and run the ftp_client ep. FileZilla server status messages will display as shown in the below image upon successful communication.
