## Overview
Examples for Renesas RA MCU family include Example Projects and Application Projects.

## Example Projects
Example projects demonstrate the operation of various peripherals available on RA MCUs. The example projects are built using components provided by FSP.  User interaction with the MCU is provided via Segger RTT, making it possible to vary the functionality of the MCU peripheral example.
